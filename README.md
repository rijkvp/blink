Blink is a program that helps you to remember to take breaks (and blink your eyes) while using the computer. 

## Features

- ‚è∞ Configure multiple timers with intervals, weights, timeouts & declining prompts.
- üîî Get a notification and play a sound when its time to take a break.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Have timers automatically pause or reset when you are AFK.

## Installation

You can download the latest executable from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rijkvp/blink/releases).

## Usage

Run the executable in the background. 
You probably want to automatically start the program when your PC boots.

## Configuration

When no config file is found a default `blink.yaml` config file will be generated like the one below.
A different config file can be specified using the `--config` flag.

```yaml
